# Description

Out of a desire to search local coffee shops based on location and ease, I have created the world renown Coffee Finder. Users can enter a location and the app will search for businesses that serve coffee. After clicking on a specific coffee shop, you can call the business via the device's phone application. A user can click on the dropped pin on the map, and the app will link to the device's mapping application (Apple Maps, or Google Maps), immediately giving directions. Users will be able to get names of nearby coffee shops by click on the blue dots on the map.
